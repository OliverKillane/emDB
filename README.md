## What is this?
An embedded, in-memory database that is generated by a schema compiler, and can be embedded in a rust application, with rust embedded inside of it.

This project is an experiment and while functional, it is not fully tested & the interface is unstable.

## Project Structure
### [`./crates` → Contains the libraries developed for this project](./crates)
### [`./bench` → Benchmarks against other systems](./bench)
### [`./book` → The emDB book](./book) [→ hosted here](https://oliverkillane.github.io/emDB/)
### [`./projects` → Projects within emDB (including the thesis this emDB was for)](./projects/)
### [`./scripts` → Helper scripts](./scripts/)

## Documentation
Can be found in the [book site](https://oliverkillane.github.io/emDB/), and built documentation from [`./crates`](./crates/).

### How to Develop
On any linux/bsd/mac/windows simply build as a normal cargo project.
```bash
cd crates
cargo test
```

On linux an additional helper scripts [scripts/setup.sh](./scripts/setup.sh) will add git hooks, install extra tooling.
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
cd crates
cargo nextest run
```

Python is used for some helper scripts used in the [thesis paper](./papers/oliverkillane_fyp/). If you have cargo, you can get relevant python versions through uv.
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/astral-sh/uv uv
```
