\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Representative Benchmarks}
To determine the advantage provided by the core concept of the project requires assessing the impact of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Optimising table access into returning references.
    \item Optimising table structures for append only workloads.
    \item Embedding application logic inside database queries.
\end{enumerate}
A direct comparison and evaluation of the specific benefits of code generation is not in the scope of this evaluation.
While there is clearly a performance advantage to be gained from running native, optimised code (without a runtime cost), \emdb
is implemented with different operators, and is currently running a simple \& easily debuggable backend that has not been optimised.
\\
\\ Ideally we would use a benchmark considered representative of embedded database workloads,
and contains schemas for which the 3 features we want to investigate are applicable.
\subsubsection{TCP-H}
Covers aggregation as well as concurrent data modification, adherence to specification
requires either using a separate driver - not easily embeddable while adhering to the specification.
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item The benchmark is designed for a persisted buisness database, so uses all mutations (insert update, delete)
          which prevents the mutability optimisations that emDB performs,
          some embedded database workloads are append only, and thus choosing a benchmark that also
          supports
    \item Concurrent modification is only possible with the current Serialized emDB backend by placing
          the entire database behind a RWLock, but TCP-H is designed in part for benchmarking \textit{concurrent data modifications}\cite{TCPHSpec}
\end{itemize}
It would be possible to heavily modify TCP-H (data generator linked with benchmarks \& in-memory, on a
low scale factor with benchmarks including no updates or deletes).
\\
\\ However this benchmark would be TCP-H in schema \& queries only (not useful to compare with other TCP-H results)
and would not be particularly useful in validating the 4 key optimisations imlemented without modifying
the sets of queries used (i.e. TCP-H, but append only).

\subsubsection{H2O.ai Database Benchmark}
This benchmark is designed for \textit{database like-tools [in] data-science}, and benchmarks aggregations
using groupby and join on an in-memory dataset\cite{H2Oai}.
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item It is used by, and since 2023 has been maintained by the DuckDb project\cite{DuckDBH2O}, and is used by that project to benchmark DuckDB's
          aggregations.
    \item As it is primarily for benchmarking aggregations over dataframes, it does not consider the impact of updates, or extracting
          data from the database. Meaning it cannot be used to assess append only workloads or returning references.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{CrossDB Bench}
Designed by the CrossDB project, the (self advertised) \textit{"fastest embedded database"}\cite{CrossDBWebsite}. The incuded benchmark compares against lmdb and sqlite3.
\\
\\ CrossDB is more comparable to a key-value store, and does not support complex operators (SELECT with computation, groupby, join etc.).
As a result the benchmark benchmarks inserts, deletes, and updates.
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item CrossDB could even be used as a backend for emDB, as emDB's operators are separate from the data storage.
    \item Despite being integrated into C (schemas are defined with C structs, custors into tables are directly accessible as part of the API,
          and reference C types)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark}
A popular and highly configurable set of benchmarks for key-value stores. Much like the CrossDB
benchmarks, the lack of complex queries means it is not useful in investigating the 3 features.

\subsubsection{Custom Benchmarks}
Rather than adapting an existing benchmark, designing a new set of test schemas and queries allowed the 3 key features to be targetted. 
Given the popularity of SQLite and DuckDB in the Rust ecosystem, these were the other embedded databases chosen for the comparison. 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r | r | r |r | r |}
        Embedded Database & SQLite & DuckDB & ExtremeDB & MonetDB/e \\
        \hline 
        crates.io All-TIme downloads &  $17,780,740$ & $174,602$ & $1,757$ & (not available) \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Other more popular \textit{embedded databases} were ommitted from the selection as they are more akin 
to transactional key-value stored. The popular \textit{"pure-rust transactional embedded database"} sled\cite{SledRepo}, LmDB\cite{LMDBWebsite} and CrossDB\cite{CrossDBWebsite} were ommitted for this reason.
\\
\\ In order to simplify the creation of new benchmarks, \emdb includes an \mintinline{rust}{Interface} backend that generates traits that can be consumed and implemented by \emdb's \mintinline{rust}{Serialized} backend, or implemented manually (to wrap other databases).
\section{[Quantitative] Performance}
\subsection{Benchmark Setup}

% fat lto for inlining - impotant for pulpit
% profile guided optimisation is optional
% using divan benchmarking library, using traits generated by emDB
% All used with entirely default configurations (except for the NoCopy)

% Benchmarks are singel threaded
% Explanation of graphs

\subsection{Data Logs}
\subsubsection{Schema}
Designed to demonstrate the impact of removing large copies (in this case of the \mintinline{rust}{comment} string), for a query on static data (i.e. a typical ETL pattern, loading data into memory and then computing).
\begin{minted}{rust}
table logs { timestamp: usize, comment: Option<String>, level: LogLevel }
pub enum LogLevel { Error, Warning, Info }
\end{minted}
Prior to the benchmarks being run, the table is populated with a number of rows equal to the scale factor.
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \mintinline{rust}{timestamp} is added sequentially up to the scale factor.
    \item \mintinline{rust}{level} is added randomly, with $20\%$ \mintinline{rust}{LogLevel::Error}, $40\%$ \mintinline{rust}{LogLevel::Warning} and $40\%$ \mintinline{rust}{LogLevel::Info}.
    \item \mintinline{rust}{comment} is added with $50\%$ \mintinline{rust}{None}, and $50\%$ containing a random string of random (uniformly distributed) lengths from $0$ to $1024$ characters.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{l p{.8\textwidth}}
    \textbf{Comment Summaries} & For each comment, get the length and the first 30 characters. \\
    \textbf{Errors per minute} & Group each error by its minute, and return the number of error logs. \\
    \textbf{Data Cleaning} & Demote all \mintinline{rust}{LogLevel::Error} logs to \mintinline{rust}{LogLevel::Warn}. \\ 
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{EmDB Implementations}
The \mintinline{rust}{NoCopySelector} table implementation selector is enabled for the no-copy \emdb
implementation. It chooses the same column data structures as the default \mintinline{rust}{MutabilitySelector}
but adds a step to copy values taken from the table.

\subsubsection{Sales Analytics}
% An OLAP workload with embedded logic
% Demonstrates the performance advantage from embedding the application logic 

\subsubsection{User Details}
% An OLTP workload with some analysis, with key-access.
% Demonstrates applicability to live data (e.g. for a live service)

\subsection{Parallelism}
% Due to the lack of a performant parallel operator implementation for emDB, performance suffers for extremely large workloads.
% - The `minister' operator library supports concurrency in its interface (and thus rustc has ensured any safe parallel implementation will compile, and will be data race-free).

% We can see performance suffer at large sale factors

\section{[Qualitative] Correctness}
\subsection{Correctness of Supporting Libraries}
Very few instances of unsafe code, ensuring normal rust safety guarantees apply.
\begin{itemize}
    \item For the unsafe code used in implementing some column data structures, kani\cite{KaniGithub} (a CBMC\cite{DiffBlueCBMC} wrapper) is used to verify abcense of generic bugs.
    \item No large test suites are present, this is a weakness for logical errors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Correctness of Code Generation}
With one key exception (accessing secondary columns without bounds checking) no \mintinline{rust}{unsafe} code is generated. Hence normal rust safety guarentees apply (no data races, no undefined behaviour, no use after free, etc.).
\begin{itemize}
    \item Normal rust safety guarentees apply to the generated code.
    \item Wrappers inside \emdb's code generation ensure quasiquotes can be re-parsed as the AST nodes they should represent (only on debug mode for performance).
    \item The produced code is human readable, a debug write mode is included to divert generated code to separate files for inspection.
\end{itemize}

The \emdb compiler currently runs on rust nightly, and hence is subject to some of the bugs associated with it.
For example 


\subsection{Durability to User Error}
Given emDB allows the user to access internal state safely to immutable values, it is critical to 
prevent bugs in user code mainfesting in difficult to debug issues inside the database.
\\
\\ For example, invalid access through an \emdb provided reference corrupting memory in a table, 
resulting in a difficult bug manifesting in failures for unrelated queries.
\\
\\ The qualification of user provided references with the database lifetime, and the accessiblity to 
internal data structures only through the safe query interface limit the exposure to bugs in user code.
However, there are still three ways in which this can be damaged.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {
        \textbf{Use of unsafe code by the user.} \\
        There is no way to prevent this, and it is clear to the user that they are using unsafe code.
    }
    \item { 
        \textbf{Use of a rust soundness hole by the user.} \\
        This is a rust compiler issue (for example the demonstrations in cve-rs\cite{CVERS})
    }
    \item { 
        \textbf{Access to internal database data structures through code embedded in operators.} \\
        User code substituted to inside the body of a query 
        can access internal variables that are in scope. This is somewhat limited by placing the generation of expressions and closures 
        before the operator implementation, however symbols such as the \mintinline{rust}{__internal_self_alias} used to access internal 
        tables are still in scope.
    }
\end{enumerate}

\begin{futurebox}{Barriers to Production Use}
    A larger test suite is required to ensure no logical errors in the `minister' operator implementations.
\end{futurebox}

\section{[Quantitative] Compile Time Cost}
% The proc-macro needs to run at compile time in order to generate the code.
% - Using cargo's internal timings data, we can see the time taken to compile the benchmarks repository.

% The current emDB compiler has a significant compile time cost when code inside the module is editted
% The upfront cost of compiling sqlite and duckDB is enormous
% emDB compiles fast enough to be usable live in the IDE (propagating error messages), even during development when modifying emDB internals.
% significant time is taken for optimising the generated data structures in 
% The data structures and operator implementations are in separate crates from the emdb proc macro.

% TODO: cargo build --timings from scratch
% TODO: cargo build --timings for second build
% TODO: cargo build --timings for bench

% Further improvements can be made to reduce compile times (feature gating operator implementations, 
% improving performance of emDB compiler).

% However there is a consideration for correctness, when using other systems a developer may need to 
% write, then test queries to catch bugs that are caught by the rust compiler and propagated to the 
% user through emDB.

\section{[Qualitative] Error Messages}
% emDB produces multiple syntax errors effectively
% some bugs to exist (cargo panic on syn)

% comparison sqlx
% requires recompile
