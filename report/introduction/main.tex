\chapter{Introduction}

% Key points
% 1. Actually memory is fine, hence in memory works
% 2. Queries are often known
% 3. Many applications need fast, correct, data stores
% 3 kinds of application to optimise


% Structure:
% What do we want, simple, fast, cheap.
% Inefficient Service Pattern
% - evidence of use - fast or cheap
% - redis/caching databases
% Slow Analysis Pattern
% - fast, cheap or simple
% Complex State Pattern
% - fast or simple

% postgres over network where is time spent
% https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Performance_Analysis_Tools

% Solutions
% faster databases - get papers
% faster storage
% faster networks - considerable part of latency

% embedded databases
% - remove network
% - remove disk

% the spectrum of embedded databases
% Comparison of performance duckdb, sqlite

% none consider fact: we know the queries we are going to run

% the query
% unspecialised data structures (queries unknown)
% specialised data structures (queries known)

% this is the essence, we can make an embedded database to take advantage of knowing all queries that can be run.
% optimise and make data structure choices based on query, rather

% the project structure

% Background
% - Similar Projects (VoltDB, duckDB)
% - intro to the rust compiler
% - intro to query language design
